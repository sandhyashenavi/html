    oranges cultivated in large part of the region.It is also called the Tiger Capital of India or the Tiger Gateway
    of India as many tiger reserves are located in and around the city and also hosts the regional office of 
    National Tiger Conservation Authority.The city was founded in 1702 by the Gond King Bakht Buland Shah of 
    Deogarh and later became a part of the Maratha Empire under the royal Bhonsale dynasty. The British East India 
    Company took over Nagpur in the 19th century and made it the capital of the Central Provinces and Berar. After 
    the first re-organisation of states, the city lost its status as the capital. Following the informal Nagpur Pact 
    between political leaders, it was made the second capital of Maharashtra.
